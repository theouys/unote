# unote Text Editor
This is a very basic and **fast** text editor that runs on MAC OS, Windows and Linux. 
All it needs to run is, Python3 with tkinter to be installed.

##Pre-requisites

###Linux (Debian base/Ubuntu)
--------------------
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-tk

###Linux (Arch)
--------------------
sudo pacman install python3
sudo pacman install python3-tk

###Redhat/Fedora (Arch)
--------------------
yum install python3
yum install python3-tk

###Redhat/Fedora (Arch)
--------------------
yum install python3
yum install python3-tk

###MACOS
-----
sudo brew install python

###Windows
Go to the official python website and download it

##Install
To install this on MACOS and Linux, run the **install.sh** file
For windows. I still need to figure out how to allow File Explorer to open files with this application. Will have a solution soon.
