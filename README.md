**Install**
------------
To install this on MACOS and Linux, run the **install.sh** file
Windows do not have a install program yet.It is coming soon. You just have to create a batch file yourself. Also for Windows you can run it, but you cannot use File Explorer yet to open files. You have to open it from the Unote application itself.
