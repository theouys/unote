UNote is a very basic text editor. The idea behind it is to be very fast.
It is written in Python3. That means you need to have pYthon 3 installed on
your system and tkinter.

You need the following to be installed as a prerequisite:

Linux (Debian base/Ubuntu)
--------------------
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-tk

Linux (Arch)
--------------------
sudo pacman install python3
sudo pacman install python3-tk

Redhat/Fedora (Arch)
--------------------
yum install python3
yum install python3-tk


Install:
--------
Unzip the zip file into the /opt folder
This will create the following folder /opt/unote with the following files in it
    unote.sh (make sure it is executable)
    unote.py
    unote (Copy to /usr/bin)
    unote
    unote.application
